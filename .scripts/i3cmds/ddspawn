# This script simplifies dropdown windows in i3.
# Shows/hides a scratchpad of a given name, if it doesn't exist, creates it.
# Usage:
#	argument 1: script to run in dropdown window
#	all other args are interpreted as options for your terminal
# My usage:
#	ddpawn
# bindsym $mod+u	exec --no-startup-id ddspawn tmuxdd
#	Will hide/show window running the `tmuxdd` script when I press mod+u in i3
# bindsym $mod+a	exec --no-startup-id ddspawn dropdowncalc -f mono:pixelsize=24
#	Similar to above but with `dropdowncalc` and the other args are interpretated as for my terminal emulator (to increase font)
