# This is fork of Voidrice by (Luke Smith <https://lukesmith.xyz>'s dotfiles)

These are the dotfiles deployed by [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz) and as seen on [Luke's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/lukesmithxyz).

I added some of my custom scripts for my need exclusively.
        - Fireplaces (auto mounting drives in particular location)
	- Myprograms ( fetches the dmenu list of programs located in isolated places of hard drives)
	- fibonacchi mode is default in dwm
	- added $FM env variable for File manager and updated in dwm build. (Saves the hassle to recompile it in dwm build)
	- vifm is default here instead of lf
	- added dt's vifmrun script in `~/.local/bin` to get image preview in vifm *successfully*.

- Other things are similar to luke's version:
