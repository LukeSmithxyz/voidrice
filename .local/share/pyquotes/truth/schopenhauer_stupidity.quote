If you come across any special trait of meanness or stupidity ... you must be
careful not to let it annoy or distress you, but to look upon it merely as an
addition to your knowledge -- a new fact to be considered in studying the
character of humanity.  Your attitude towards it will be that of the
mineralogist who stumbles upon very characteristic specimen of a mineral.
    -- Arthur Schopenhauer
