! Title: EFF DNT Policy Whitelist
! Expires: 5 days
! Last Scanned: Tue Oct 29 00:00:08 UTC 2019
!
! EFF generates this whitelist by scanning the Majestic
! top 1 million sites
! (https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million)
! to see if a compliant Do Not Track policy is posted at
! /.well-known/dnt-policy.txt on each. EFF has no way
! of verifying whether the domain actually complies with
! the policy. The whitelist is updated with each scan.
!
! Note that this filter list will only
! be effective if you enable the DNT=1
! header in your browser (Privacy Badger
! does this automatically).
!
! report problems, comments, requests to
! dnt-policy@eff.org
