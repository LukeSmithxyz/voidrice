! uBlock Origin -- Experimental filters.
!
! These filters are experimental and may cause breakage. They are being
! evaluated/fine-tuned for inclusion in the default set of filters.
!
! The `important` filter option is often used here in order to ensure the
! experimental filters are used, i.e. they will override existing exception
! filters which might exist to unbreak known web page breakage.

! googletagservices.com not blocked by EasyPrivacy (I don't know why).
! This is a redirection-based filter being developed in order to be able
! to safely block `googletagservices.com` everywhere by default.
||googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js$script,redirect=googletagservices.com/gpt.js,important

! www.google-analytics.com
! The goal is to be able to block `www.google-analytics.com` while preventing
! web page breakage.
