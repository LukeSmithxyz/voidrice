# When I open an image from the file manager in sxiv (the image viewer), I want
# to be able to press the next/previous keys to key through the rest of the
# images in the same directory. This script "rotates" the content of a
# directory based on the first chosen file, so that if I open the 15th image,
# if I press next, it will go to the 16th etc. Autistic, I know, but this is
# one of the reasons that sxiv is great for being able to read standard input.
