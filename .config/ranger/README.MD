# Luke's ranger setup

## Basic Ranger shortcuts

These are the basic key binds in ranger, even outside of my configs. Note that they are mostly vim-based.

+ h/j/k/l -- Move left/down/up/right (where left moves up in the directory structure, right moves into a folder)
+ Space -- select/highlight file
+ dd -- cut selected files
+ yy -- copy/yank selected files
+ pp -- paste/move cut/copied files
+ / -- search, when (n/N) next/previous result
+ zh or CTRL-h -- show hidden files
+ Renaming files:
	+ cw -- rename file from scratch
	+ A -- rename file adding to the end
	+ aa -- rename file appending before the extension
	+ I -- rename file adding at the beginning

## Shortcuts

As I say in the main readme, there are shortcut commands generated for ranger
based on what bookmarked directories and files you give it. For directory
shortcuts, here are the "verbs":

+ g -- "go or cd"
+ t -- "new tab"
+ m -- "move file"
+ Y -- "yank or copy file"

These "verbs" take "nouns" or "arguments," like these:

+ d -- "~/Documents"
+ D -- "~/Downloads"
+ cf -- "~/.config"
+ And many others, including those you add to `~/.bmdirs`.

Press any "verb" followed by any "argument" to perform a folder operation. "gd" will cd to ~/Documents, for example. "mD" will move the selected file(s) to ~/Downloads. "tcf" will create a new tab in ~/.config, etc. etc.
