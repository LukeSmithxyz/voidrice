This directory is dedicated for user-supplied scripts/executables.
vifm modifies its PATH environment variable to let user run those
scripts without specifying full path.  All subdirectories are added
as well.  File in a subdirectory overrules file with the same name
in parent directories.  Restart might be needed to recognize files
in newly created or renamed subdirectories.
