#Here you can put email aliases. Here's an example:

alias luke luke@lukesmith.xyz

#When you put "luke" as the recipient in mutt, it will automatically direct it to my email address.

#You can also put multiple emails under one aliases:

alias project_members billy@gmail.com, sally@gmail.com, amanda@gmail.com, chad@gmail.com

#With the above alias, if you put "project_members" as the recipient, mutt will fill in all the emails above as the recipients.
#
#This is extremely useful, so take advantage of it!
